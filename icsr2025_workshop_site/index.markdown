Touch is one of the most fundamental and emotionally powerful forms of human interaction. As social robots become increasingly present in everyday environments—such as healthcare, education, and the home—their ability to perceive, interpret, and respond to touch becomes crucial for enabling natural and meaningful human-robot interactions. This workshop explores the central role of touch in social robotics, going beyond words to investigate how haptic technologies and embodied interaction models shape the way robots engage with humans.


The workshop brings together leading experts who have pioneered research in tactile sensing, affective touch, human-robot physical interaction, and cognitive models of embodiment. Through presentations and discussions, participants will gain a deeper understanding of how touch can be integrated into robot design and behavior, and what ethical, social, and technical challenges arise in doing so.


This workshop seeks to create a dialogue across robotics, neuroscience, psychology, and design, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. In doing so, it aims to address a fundamental question: How can we enable robots to touch—and what implications does that have for human-robot interaction?
The workshop will highlight diverse touch modalities including force, pressure, vibration, and temperature sensing, as well as advances in artificial skin technologies that enable spatially distributed, multimodal tactile perception. It will also address emerging methods in soft robotics and wearable systems, and their implications for affective communication and safety in physical human-robot interaction. Emphasis will be placed on both the technological enablers and the cognitive models that allow robots to contextualize touch.
