            <p><strong>Short bio:</strong> She is currently a full professor in the Autonomous Systems and Robotics Lab in the Computer Science and System Engineering Department (U2IS) at ENSTA Paris, France. She received her PhD in computer science from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, in 2005, and her degree in engineering in computer science and engineering from the Politehnica University of Bucharest, Romania, in 2001. She worked as an Associate Researcher at the University of Southern California (USC), where she was among the pioneers in the development of socially assistive robotics, also participating in activities in machine learning, human sensing, and human-robot interaction. Her main interests are long-term learning (i.e., in particular, interaction with humans), human modeling, and online robot behavior adaptation to external environmental factors. Prof. Tapus is an Associate Editor for IJSR, T-HRI, and Senior Editor for the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR). She was also on the steering committee of several major robotics conferences (General Chair 2019 of HRI, Program Chair 2018 of HRI). She has more than 200 research publications, and she received the Romanian Academy Award for her contributions to assistive robotics in 2010.</p>

            <p><strong>Short bio:</strong> Patrick Hénaff is a full professor at the École Nationale d’Ingénieurs de Brest (ENIB), where he teaches in the Computer Science Department and conducts research at the Lab-STICC (UMR CNRS 6285), within the Interaction Department’s RAMBO team.
            His research focuses on biologically inspired control systems for humanoid robots, with particular interest in neural network models for dynamic behaviors such as rhythmic limb movements and adaptive gait patterns. His work aims to enhance human-robot interaction through natural, compensatory motion strategies. Previously, he served as a full professor at the École des Mines de Nancy and has held various research and leadership roles at institutions including LORIA, ETIS, and LISV. He holds a PhD in Robotics from the University Pierre et Marie Curie and an HDR (Habilitation) from the University of Cergy Pontoise

            <p><strong>Short bio:</strong> He is a PhD student in the Autonomous Systems and Robotics Lab in the Computer Science and System Engineering Department (U2IS) at ENSTA Paris, France. He received his master’s degree from the University of Strasbourg and the the engineering science, computer science and imaging laboratory in Strasbourg, and his mechatronics engineering diploma from Tishreen University, Latakia. He explores the integration of haptic feedback into robotic systems towards socio-affective touch. His research focuses on tactile sensing, and robot design towards intuitive and meaningful human-robot interactions. With a background in mechatronics, biomedical engineering, and medical robotics, he worked on interdisciplinary projects that span both academic and industry settings. He has contributed to research in diverse team settings to address complex challenges at the intersection of engineering and human-centered design. He has co-authored several peer-reviewed publications and a patent and enjoys engaging with the robotics community through conferences and collaborative research.</p>
