            <p><strong>Talk title:</strong> The Haptic Intelligence of HERA and HuggieBot</p>
            <p><strong>Short bio:</strong> Katherine J. Kuchenbecker is a Director at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS) in Stuttgart, Germany, and an Honorary Professor at the University of Stuttgart. She earned her Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University in 2006, did postdoctoral research at Johns Hopkins University, and was an engineering professor in the GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania from 2007 to 2016. Her research blends haptics, teleoperation, physical human-robot interaction, tactile sensing, and medical applications. She delivered a TEDYouth talk on haptics in 2012 and has been honored with a 2009 NSF CAREER Award, the 2012 IEEE RAS Academic Early Career Award, a 2014 Penn Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching, elevation to IEEE Fellow in 2021, and various best paper, poster, demonstration, and reviewer awards.</p>

            <p>Assistant Professor at IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
            <p><strong>Talk title:</strong> Toward anxiety-reducing therapeutic pocket robots for children</p>
            <p><strong>Short bio:</strong> Morten Roed Frederiksen is a robotics engineer and software developer specializing in agentic control architectures for large language model-driven robots. His work bridges AI, affective computing, and human-robot interaction to design socially intelligent systems capable of adaptive, emotionally responsive behavior. Mortenâ€™s research spans reinforcement learning, physiological sensing, and long-term interaction design, with a strong focus on supporting mental well-being through empathetic robotics. He holds a PhD in robotics and is a Fulbright Scholar.</p>
